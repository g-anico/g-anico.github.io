	<p>Nate and Damien are my two nephews. I love them more than life itself. It doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, I can't express how much I love them so this page will have to do. They are so cute, I want to hug them, squeeze them, and keep them all to myself. Their moms get a little worried when I squeeze them too hard. It's just my way of expressing how much I love them...</p>

	<h2>Nate</h2>

	<p>Nate is my sister's kid. He was born in Singapore and currently resides in Taiwan. He's a strange little toddler. He loves to dance and act goofy. His favorite toys are Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. His favorite website is Youtube. Trying to wean him from Youtube has been hard. Sometimes I videocall him and he shows me all his cool new toys and sings for me. I have a feeling there's something very fabulous about him. He's turning three this July but he'll always be a baby monkey in my eyes.</p>

	<p>Damien is my cousin's kid. He was born in Oakland, California and currently resides in San Gabriel, CA. At two and a half, he's already very opinionated and stubborn. However, he's a funny little monkey, and when I say "monkey," I mean it. He's tan, very physically active, and loves being naughty. He tests and pushes boundaries every day to his mom's delight (and occasionally, dismay). His favorite toys are fire engines, trucks, and airplanes and he's currently obsessed with aliens. He'll be turning three this September but he'll always be a baby monkey in my eyes.</p>
