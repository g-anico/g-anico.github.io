	<p>Nate and Damien are my two nephews. I love them more than life itself. It doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, I can't express how much I love them so this page will have to do. They are so cute, I want to hug them, squeeze them, and keep them all to myself. Their moms get a little worried when I squeeze them too hard. It's just my way of expressing how much I love them...</p>

	<h2>Nate</h2>

	<p>Nate is my sister's kid. He was born in Singapore and currently resides in Taiwan. He loves to climb stairs, play hide-and-seek, and make silly noises. He also likes being chased, shuffling his feet, and learning new words. His favorite website is Youtube. Have you ever tried to take a tablet from a toddler when they're on Youtube? Try it sometime! When he's not plugged in, he's quite curious about the world around him and asks what things are. He's turning three this July but he'll always be a baby monkey in my eyes.</p>

	<p>Damien is my cousin's kid. He was born in Oakland, California and currently resides in San Gabriel, CA. At two and a half, he's already very opinionated and stubborn. However, he's a funny little monkey, and when I say "monkey," I mean it. He's tan, very physically active, and loves being naughty. He tests and pushes boundaries every day to his mom's delight (and occasionally, dismay). His favorite toys are fire engines, trucks, and airplanes. He's currently obsessed with aliens. He'll be turning three this September but he'll always be a baby monkey in my eyes.</p>
